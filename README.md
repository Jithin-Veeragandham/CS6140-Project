## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

With over a billion enterprise and consumer customers, Microsoft takes cybersecurity very seriously. As part of their initiative to improve global protection standards, Microsoft released a large-scale telemetry dataset, challenging the data science community to predict whether a machine will be affected by malware in the near future.

The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can effectively identify potential malware infections based on rich, anonymized telemetry data. The dataset reflects real-world challenges such as missing values, mixed data types, and distribution shifts between training and test sets.

This project is based on the official Kaggle competition:
